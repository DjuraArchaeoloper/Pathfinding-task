# fatcat-Pathfinding-task

This is my solution to the pathfinding task. You can change the grid size in gridMatrix at the bottom, which is currently set to be 10 * 10, and also the number of obstacles which is set to be 20.

Run the code by typing "node index.js" in your command prompt, which means you need to have node installed on your device.
